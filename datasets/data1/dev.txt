@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke	0
@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue	0
@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 ("uplink prob"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?	0
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United	0
@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.	0
@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!	0
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.	0

@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????	0
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.	0
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons	0
@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...	0
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate	0
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.	0
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.	0
@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??	0
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity	0
@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?	0

@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don鈥檛 see that it has taken off yet	0
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted	0
@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?	0
@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night "as fast as they can", you should reconsider what you think that means.	0
@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United	0
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead	0
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.	0
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.	0
@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united	0
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence	0

@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded	0
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD	0
@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.	0
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx	0
@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.	0
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!	0
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars	0
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds	0
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS	0
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter	0
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!	0
@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!	0

@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.	0
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic	0
@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away	0
@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).	0
@united it will be on a different airline.	0
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.	0

@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?	0

@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.	0
@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5	0
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.	0
Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you "can't do anything" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7	0
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw	0
@united you guys suck!	0
@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.	0

@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember	0
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.	0
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M	0
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.	0
@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but "unavailable"to book. False advertising much?	0
@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes "like every 15 minutes." Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?	0
@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?	0
@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.	0
@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks	0
@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.	0
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag	0
@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?	0
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united	0
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.	0
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.	0

@united Your "Loyalty Team" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google "loyalty" and get back to me? ^LOL	0
Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks	0
@united, if you mean beyond opaque "maintenance issues", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.	0
@united "Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"	0
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful	0
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)	0
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!	0
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.	0
@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.	0

@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.	0
@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!	0
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.	0
@united not the case. Now delayed due to "mechanical issues with no update on departure time". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta	0

@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.	0
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.	0
@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.	0
@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA	0
@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL	0
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!	0
